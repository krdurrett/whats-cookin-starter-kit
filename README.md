## Wins
  - We had a smooth workflow that allowed for consistent progress
  - We met our goal to learn
  - We accomplished the required functionality

## Challenges + Improvements
  - We were unable to implement the third part library because glide.js requires SASS and we haven't implemented that in our project yet.
  - We discovered a problem in the data set and found a way around it by adding a conditional to our JavaScript.
  - Future Iterations: We plan to implement a third party library. We could also include a rating system. Add additional functionality to the "To Cook" feature
