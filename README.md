## Illustrations

 - A user starts on the home view.

 - Each recipe card has a heart and cookpot icon.
 - When the heart is clicked, the recipe is added to the "Favorites" section and can be viewed by clicking, "View Favorites"
 - When the cookpot is clicked, the recipe is added to the "To Cook" section and can be viewed by clicking the "To Cook" button
 - When a user clicks "To Cook", each recipe indicates whether or not the user has enough ingredients in their pantry and gives the option to add the ingredients.
 - In the "To Cook" view, the user also has the option to cook the recipes that they have the ingredients for in their pantry.
 - When the user cooks a meal, the ingredients are subtracted from thier pantry
 - The user can view their pantry by clicking the "Pantry" button.
 - To return to the home page, user can click the "home" button in the upper left hand corner

## Wins
